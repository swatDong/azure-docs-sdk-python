        should respond to them.
      id: exit_codes
      type:
      - list of ExitCodeMapping
    - description: A list of task exit code ranges and how the Batch service should
        respond to them.
      id: exit_code_ranges
      type:
      - list of ExitCodeRangeMapping
    - description: How the Batch service should respond if the task fails to start
        due to an error.

      type:
      - ExitOptions
    - description: How the Batch service should respond if a file upload error occurs.
        If the task exited with an exit code that was specified via exitCodes or exitCodeRanges,
        and then encountered a file upload error, then the action specified by the
        exit code takes precedence.
      id: file_upload_error
      type:
      - ExitOptions
    - description: How the Batch service should respond if the task fails with an
        exit condition not covered by any of the other properties. This value is used
        if the task exits with any nonzero exit code not listed in the exitCodes or
        exitCodeRanges collection, with a pre-processing error if the preProcessingError
        property is not present, or with a file upload error if the fileUploadError
        property is not present. If you want non-default behaviour on exit code 0,
        you must list it explicitly using the exitCodes or exitCodeRanges collection.
