  summary: 'Bases: `msrest.serialization.Model`

    The execution constraints for a job.'
  syntax:
    content: JobConstraints(self, max_wall_clock_time=None, max_task_retry_count=None)
    parameters:
    - description: The maximum elapsed time that the job may run, measured from the
        time the job is created. If the job does not complete within the time limit,
        the Batch service terminates it and any tasks that are still running. In this
        case, the termination reason will be MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property
        is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the job may run.
      id: max_wall_clock_time
      type:
      - timedelta
    - description: The maximum number of times each task may be retried. The Batch
        service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically
        controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try each task once,
        and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count
        is 3, Batch tries a task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If
        the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry tasks. If the
        maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries tasks without limit.
        The default value is 0 (no retries).
