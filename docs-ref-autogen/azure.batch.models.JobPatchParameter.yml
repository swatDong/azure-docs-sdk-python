  summary: 'Bases: `msrest.serialization.Model`

    The set of changes to be made to a job.'
  syntax:
    content: JobPatchParameter(self, priority=None, on_all_tasks_complete=None, constraints=None,
      pool_info=None, metadata=None)
    parameters:
    - description: The priority of the job. Priority values can range from -1000 to
        1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000 being the highest priority.
        If omitted, the priority of the job is left unchanged.
      id: priority
      type:
      - int
    - description: 'The action the Batch service should take when all tasks in the
        job are in the completed state. If omitted, the completion behavior is left
        unchanged. You may not change the value from terminateJob to noAction - that
        is, once you have engaged automatic job termination, you cannot turn it off
        again. If you try to do this, the request fails with an ''invalid property
        value'' error response; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP
        status code is 400 (Bad Request). Possible values include: ''noAction'', ''terminateJob'''
      id: on_all_tasks_complete
      type:
      - str or OnAllTasksComplete
    - description: The execution constraints for the job. If omitted, the existing
        execution constraints are left unchanged.
      id: constraints
      type:
      - JobConstraints
    - description: The pool on which the Batch service runs the job's tasks. You may
        change the pool for a job only when the job is disabled. The Patch Job call
        will fail if you include the poolInfo element and the job is not disabled.
        If you specify an autoPoolSpecification specification in the poolInfo, only
        the keepAlive property can be updated, and then only if the auto pool has
        a poolLifetimeOption of job. If omitted, the job continues to run on its current
        pool.
      id: pool_info
      type:
      - PoolInformation
    - description: A list of name-value pairs associated with the job as metadata.
        If omitted, the existing job metadata is left unchanged.
      id: metadata
