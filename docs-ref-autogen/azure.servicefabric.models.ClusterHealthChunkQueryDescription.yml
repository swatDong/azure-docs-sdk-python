  summary: 'Bases: `msrest.serialization.Model`

    The cluster health chunk query description, which can specify the health policies
    to evaluate cluster health and very expressive filters to select which cluster
    entities to include in response.'
  syntax:
    content: ClusterHealthChunkQueryDescription(self, node_filters=None, application_filters=None,
      cluster_health_policy=None, application_health_policies=None)
    parameters:
    - description: Defines a list of filters that specify which nodes to be included
        in the returned cluster health chunk. If no filters are specified, no nodes
        are returned. All the nodes are used to evaluate the cluster's aggregated
        health state, regardless of the input filters. The cluster health chunk query
        may specify multiple node filters. For example, it can specify a filter to
        return all nodes with health state Error and another filter to always include
        a node identified by its NodeName.

    - description: Defines a list of filters that specify which applications to be
        included in the returned cluster health chunk. If no filters are specified,
        no applications are returned. All the applications are used to evaluate the
        cluster's aggregated health state, regardless of the input filters. The cluster
        health chunk query may specify multiple application filters. For example,
        it can specify a filter to return all applications with health state Error
        and another filter to always include applications of a specified application
        type.
