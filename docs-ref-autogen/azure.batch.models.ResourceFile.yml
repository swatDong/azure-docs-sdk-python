  summary: 'Bases: `msrest.serialization.Model`

    A file to be downloaded from Azure blob storage to a compute node.'
  syntax:

    parameters:
    - description: 'The URL of the file within Azure Blob Storage. This URL must be
        readable using anonymous access; that is, the Batch service does not present
        any credentials when downloading the blob. There are two ways to get such
        a URL for a blob in Azure storage: include a Shared Access Signature (SAS)
        granting read permissions on the blob, or set the ACL for the blob or its
        container to allow public access.'

      type:

    - description: The location on the compute node to which to download the file,
        relative to the task's working directory.

      type:
      - str
    - description: The file permission mode attribute in octal format. This property
        applies only to files being downloaded to Linux compute nodes. It will be
        ignored if it is specified for a resourceFile which will be downloaded to
        a Windows node. If this property is not specified for a Linux node, then a
        default value of 0770 is applied to the file.
