  summary: 'Bases: `msrest.serialization.Model`

    parameters:
    - description: 'The ARM resource identifier of the virtual network subnet which
        the compute nodes of the pool will join. This is of the form /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/{provider}/virtualNetworks/{network}/subnets/{subnet}.
        The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the Azure
        Batch account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to
        accommodate the number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet doesn''t have enough
        free IP addresses, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes, and a resize
        error will occur. The Batch service principal, named ''Microsoft Azure Batch''
        or ''MicrosoftAzureBatch'', must have the ''Classic Virtual Machine Contributor''
        Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The specified
        subnet must allow communication from the Azure Batch service to be able to
        schedule tasks on the compute nodes. This can be verified by checking if the
        specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups

        (NSG). If communication to the compute nodes in the specified subnet is denied
        by an NSG, then the Batch service will set the state of the compute nodes
        to unusable. For pools created via virtualMachineConfiguration the Batch account
        must have poolAllocationMode userSubscription in order to use a VNet.'
