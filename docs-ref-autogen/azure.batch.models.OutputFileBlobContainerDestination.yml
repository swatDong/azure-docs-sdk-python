  summary: 'Bases: `msrest.serialization.Model`

    Specifies a file upload destination within an Azure blob storage container.'
  syntax:
    content: OutputFileBlobContainerDestination(self, container_url, path=None)
    parameters:
    - description: The destination blob or virtual directory within the Azure Storage
        container. If filePattern refers to a specific file (i.e. contains no wildcards),
        then path is the name of the blob to which to upload that file. If filePattern
        contains one or more wildcards (and therefore may match multiple files), then
        path is the name of the blob virtual directory (which is prepended to each
        blob name) to which to upload the file(s). If omitted, file(s) are uploaded
        to the root of the container with a blob name matching their file name.
      id: path
      type:
      - str
    - description: The URL of the container within Azure Blob Storage to which to
        upload the file(s). The URL must include a Shared Access Signature (SAS) granting
        write permissions to the container.
