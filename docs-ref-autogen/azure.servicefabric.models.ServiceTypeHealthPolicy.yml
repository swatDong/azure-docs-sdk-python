        the maximum tolerated percentage of partitions that can be unhealthy before

    - description: 'The maximum maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy services.
        Allowed values are Byte values from zero to 100. The percentage represents
        the maximum tolerated percentage of services that can be unhealthy before
        the application is considered in error. If the percentage is respected but
        there is at least one unhealthy service, the health is evaluated as Warning.
        This is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy services of the specific
        service type over the total number of services of the specific service type.
        The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of services.
