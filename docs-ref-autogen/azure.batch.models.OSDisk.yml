  summary: 'Bases: `msrest.serialization.Model`

  syntax:
    content: OSDisk(self, image_uris, caching=None)
    parameters:
    - description: The collection of Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) URIs. All the VHDs must
        be identical and must reside in an Azure Storage account within the same subscription
        and same region as the Batch account. For best performance, it is recommended
        that each VHD resides in a separate Azure Storage account. Each VHD can serve
        upto 20 Windows compute nodes or 40 Linux compute nodes. You must supply enough
        VHD URIs to satisfy the 'targetDedicated' property of the pool. If you do
        not supply enough VHD URIs, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes,
        and a resize error will occur.
