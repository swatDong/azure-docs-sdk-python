  syntax:
    content: TaskConstraints(self, max_wall_clock_time=None, retention_time=None,
      max_task_retry_count=None)
    parameters:
    - description: The maximum elapsed time that the task may run, measured from the
        time the task starts. If the task does not complete within the time limit,
        the Batch service terminates it. If this is not specified, there is no time
        limit on how long the task may run.
      id: max_wall_clock_time
      type:
      - timedelta
    - description: The minimum time to retain the task directory on the compute node
        where it ran, from the time it completes execution. After this time, the Batch
        service may delete the task directory and all its contents. The default is
        infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the compute node
        is removed or reimaged.
      id: retention_time
      type:
      - timedelta
    - description: The maximum number of times the task may be retried. The Batch
        service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically
        controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try the task once,
        and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count
        is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries).
        If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task.
        If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the task without
        limit.
