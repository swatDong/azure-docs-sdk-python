  summary: 'Bases: `msrest.serialization.Model`

    A job schedule that allows recurring jobs by specifying when to run jobs and a
    specification used to create each job.'
  syntax:
    content: JobScheduleAddParameter(self, id, schedule, job_specification, display_name=None,
      metadata=None)
    parameters:
    - description: A string that uniquely identifies the schedule within the account.
        The ID can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens
        and underscores, and cannot contain more than 64 characters. The id is case-preserving
        and case-insensitive (that is, you may not have two ids within an account
        that differ only by case).
      id: id
      type:
      - str
    - description: The display name for the schedule. The display name need not be
        unique and can contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of 1024.
      id: display_name
      type:
      - str
    - description: The schedule according to which jobs will be created.
      id: schedule
      type:
      - Schedule
    - description: The details of the jobs to be created on this schedule.
      id: job_specification
      type:
      - JobSpecification
    - description: A list of name-value pairs associated with the schedule as metadata.
        The Batch service does not assign any meaning to metadata; it is solely for
        the use of user code.
      id: metadata
