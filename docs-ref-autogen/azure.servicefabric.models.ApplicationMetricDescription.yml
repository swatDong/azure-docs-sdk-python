  summary: 'Bases: `msrest.serialization.Model`

    Describes capacity information for a custom resource balancing metric. This can
    be used to limit the total consumption of this metric by the services of this
    application. .'

      reservation_capacity=None, total_application_capacity=None)

      - str
    - description: The maximum node capacity for Service Fabric application. This
        is the maximum Load for an instance of this application on a single node.
        Even if the capacity of node is greater than this value, Service Fabric will
        limit the total load of services within the application on each node to this
        value. If set to zero, capacity for this metric is unlimited on each node.
        When creating a new application with application capacity defined, the product
        of MaximumNodes and this value must always be smaller than or equal to TotalApplicationCapacity.
        When updating existing application with application capacity, the product
        of MaximumNodes and this value must always be smaller than or equal to TotalApplicationCapacity.

    - description: The node reservation capacity for Service Fabric application. This
        is the amount of load which is reserved on nodes which have instances of this
        application. If MinimumNodes is specified, then the product of these values
        will be the capacity reserved in the cluster for the application. If set to
        zero, no capacity is reserved for this metric. When setting application capacity
        or when updating application capacity; this value must be smaller than or
        equal to MaximumCapacity for each metric.

    - description: The total metric capacity for Service Fabric application. This
        is the total metric capacity for this application in the cluster. Service
        Fabric will try to limit the sum of loads of services within the application
        to this value. When creating a new application with application capacity defined,
        the product of MaximumNodes and MaximumCapacity must always be smaller than
        or equal to this value.
