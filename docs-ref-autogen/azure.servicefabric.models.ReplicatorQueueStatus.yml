  summary: 'Bases: `msrest.serialization.Model`

    Provides various statistics of the queue used in the service fabric replicator.
    Contains information about the service fabric replicator like the replication/copy
    queue utilization, last acknowledgement received timestamp, etc. Depending on
    the role of the replicator, the properties in this type imply different meanings.

    parameters:
    - description: Represents the utilization of the queue. A value of 0 indicates
        that the queue is empty and a value of 100 indicates the queue is full.
      id: queue_utilization_percentage
      type:
      - int
    - description: Represents the virtual memory consumed by the queue in bytes.
      id: queue_memory_size
      type:
      - str
    - description: On a primary replicator, this is semantically the sequence number
        of the operation for which all the secondary replicas have sent an acknowledgement.
        On a secondary replicator, this is the smallest sequence number of the operation
        that is present in the queue.
      id: first_sequence_number
      type:
      - str
    - description: On a primary replicator, this is semantically the highest sequence
        number of the operation for which all the secondary replicas have sent an
        acknowledgement. On a secondary replicator, this is semantically the highest
        sequence number that has been applied to the persistent state.
      id: completed_sequence_number
      type:
      - str
    - description: On a primary replicator, this is semantically the highest sequence
        number of the operation for which a write quorum of the secondary replicas
        have sent an acknowledgement. On a secondary replicator, this is semantically
        the highest sequence number of the in-order operation received from the primary.
      id: committed_sequence_number
      type:
      - str
    - description: Represents the latest sequence number of the operation that is
        available in the queue.
