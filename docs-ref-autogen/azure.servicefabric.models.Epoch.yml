    An Epoch is a configuration number for the partition as a whole. When the configuration
    of the replica set changes, for example when the Primary replica changes, the
    operations that are replicated from the new Primary replica are said to be a new
    Epoch from the ones which were sent by the old Primary replica. .'

        number is an increasing value that is updated whenever the configuration of
